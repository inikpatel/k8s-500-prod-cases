## 📘 Scenario #1: Zombie Pods Causing NodeDrain to Hang

- **Category**: Cluster Management  
- **Environment**: K8s v1.23, On-prem bare metal, Systemd cgroups  

### Scenario Summary
Node drain stuck indefinitely due to unresponsive terminating pod.

### What Happened
A pod with a custom finalizer never completed termination, blocking `kubectl drain`. Even after the pod was marked for deletion, the API server kept waiting because the finalizer wasn’t removed.

### Diagnosis Steps
- Checked `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide` to find lingering pods.
- Found pod stuck in `Terminating` state for over 20 minutes.
- Used `kubectl describe pod <pod>` to identify the presence of a custom finalizer.
- Investigated controller logs managing the finalizer – the controller had crashed.

### Root Cause
Finalizer logic was never executed because its controller was down, leaving the pod undeletable.

### Fix/Workaround
```bash
kubectl patch pod <pod-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
